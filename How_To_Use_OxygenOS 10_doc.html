	  <p>OnePlus has been a heated company filed under many controversies, but with many strengths and virtues that turned them – and their product – into one of the biggest buzz-filled and talked-about entities of the mobile world in 2014. Their debut with the OnePlus One “flagship killer” was met with a lot of conversation surrounding not just the phone, but the company’s decisions around their promotion decisions. In the end, their first device was a success that sold nearly 1 million devices last year despite virtually no (traditional) advertisement and some severe hardware supply shortages. The start-up had a rough and interesting history full of ups and downs that passed onto their product, something we covered in this in-depth recapitulation of the 2014 events OnePlus went through. But if there’s something worth noting out of that turbulent history is their software relationships with CyanogenMod, and the controversy it spawned.</p>
